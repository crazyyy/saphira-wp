== Description ==
WordPress theme structure is complex and sometimes it is difficult to know which template to change when customizing.
This plugin displays a list of templates used to display the current page.
It recognizes all of the constituent templates, including the parent theme, even if you are using a child theme.

From 2.0.2, it is also possible to extract the configuration template loaded from the plugin folder when using WooCommerce.
